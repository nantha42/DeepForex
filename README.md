# Abstract
In this project, we propose a novel approach using a combination of the Transformer model and Deep Q-Network (DQN) for making trades by a trading agent. The traditional approach to financial trading often relies on trend analysis and historical patterns. However, we introduce an alternative learning algorithm that leverages the power of transformer models to improve financial trading outcomes.

Our approach involves training a transformer model to predict future prices in the market. This trained transformer model is then utilized for price prediction, which forms the basis of our input pre-processing method. By incorporating the transformer model's accurate predictions into the trading process, we aim to enhance trading decisions.

The predictions from the transformer model, along with the trading agent's account information, are fed into the DQN at each time step. The DQN agent utilizes this information to make buy or sell decisions with the goal of maximizing profits. Compared to traditional methods like Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), the transformer model offers advantages in terms of information processing. While GRU relies on previous time step information and may encounter information loss due to memory gating, the transformer model processes all time steps in parallel, ensuring no information loss and enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the market conditions.

Through our experiments, this project demonstrates the predictive power of transformer models compared to GRU models, showcasing the potential of transformers in developing effective trading bots. Additionally, the model learns to avoid losses and incorporates basic trading strategies into its decision-making process.
